I cannot remember a time when I didn't have a fear of public speaking. I recall having to give a presentation in one of my high school classes. I don't remember the topic, but I remember being randomly chosen as the first speaker. I remember having a shaky voice and knees because of the nerves, and I can remember hating every minute of it.

It wasn't just public speaking in the traditional sense, even speaking in large meetings made me nervous.

I'm not alone in this fear, you have probably heard about surveys that often show people [fear public speaking more than death itself](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death).

I don't know why I feel this way, I didn't have any experiences to put me into this state, it's just how I felt every time I have to speak in front of a group of people.

In the last 18 months, I've been working on my fear. I am closing out 2017 having spoken at these major events in the last 18 months:
* Coolblue Behind the Scenes (July 2016) - Rotterdam, The Netherlands - Joint talk with Flynn Bundy with 90 attendees
* Dutch PowerShell User Group (Sept 2016) - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - 25 attendees
* PSConfEU (May 2017) - Hannover, Germany - 40 attendees
* SplunkLive! Utrecht (Nov 2017) - Utrecht, The Netherlands - Opening customer presenter speaking to all 400 attendees

I still have my fear, and I stress a lot on the build-up to my talks, but looking back two years ago I would never have thought I would ever speak at a conference.

In this post, I want to take you through what I think are the key things that have helped me over the last 18 months to get me where I am with my fear.

# Starting small

At [Coolblue](https://careersatcoolblue.nl), we work in two-week sprints. At the end of each sprint, teams will demo what they have been doing over course of the sprint, and what they have coming up.

The demos are done in front of a small group of colleges that you know and work with closely, so this was a low barrier to entry for me to get started speaking to a group.

I didn't really want to do the speaking at first and had eager teammates that would happily speak on behalf of the team at the end of the sprint, but this was my first internal challenge. It was a small enough step that I felt comfortable with speaking in front of my colleges but big enough that I was going out of my comfort zone.

# Speak often

As I was getting more comfortable speaking in front of colleges, I started to increase the number of presentations I was doing internally. As part of my role as a Technical Pathfinder, I help teams get the most out of our logging and monitoring tools, and help them to think about monitoring their applications from a business perspective.

Monitoring is a topic I was pretty fond of, and could easily speak about at length, so it made a good choice for writing a training presentation about.

I created a presentation on the basic concepts of monitoring and ran it with almost every team. Doing the same presentation over and over again quickly becomes normal, and you realize you no longer get nerves about it.

Additionally, I also started an internal "Monitoring Meetup" where teams get to show-off cool things they have done with monitoring and learn from each other. I would usually to a 5-minute presentation before and after this meetup to make sure I was speaking regularly.

# Realize you have a story to tell

After a few years of work, you start to collect some stories about what you have achieved, or what you have failed at and learnt from.

An outlet for these learnings for me is my blog. I've had a pretty good response when I post, and people seem to like following the blog and enjoy my style of writing and talking about what I have learnt.

This was a good bridge into the talk at the Dutch PowerShell User Group. I took a post that I had already written ([ChatOps with Hubot and PowerShell](https://hodgkins.io/chatops-on-windows-with-hubot-and-powershell)) and repurposed it into a presentation. This took a lot of the stress away from having to come up with a presentation for the user group as I already had most of the content already created.

Tip: Write down your stories and work achievements (and failures). It gives you a lot of easy material to refer back to and convert into presentations later.

# Do a joint presentation

At Coolblue, an event called [Behind the Scenes](https://www.coolblue.nl/behindthescenes), where a few times a year, different teams from the Coolblue Tech Department give presentations to an external audience to give attendees a taste of what sort of thing we are doing at Coolblue.

Our team was chosen as the one to do the presentation for the event, which of course filled me with dread as I would have to speak in front of a lot of people.

One of my team members was Flynn Bundy, who is a comfortable public speaker. We teamed up for the talk and did a 45-minute joint presentation to an audience of around 90. There was no way I would have been comfortable doing this myself at this stage, but having someone to work on it with and present with made the stress manageable. Again, pushing the comfort zone just far enough to get a little more comfortable.

This also provided me with a "safety net". If for some reason I was too nervous or shaky to do something, Flynn could simply take over the session and the crowd would be none the wiser. Luckily we didn't need to do this and our presentation was well received.

Tip: If possible, do some talks with a friend or college. It makes the stress and build up to the presentation more manageable, and if you get too nervous it allows them to take over.

# Be inspired by others

As I mentioned, I worked with Flynn, who had done a few conference talks before. He wasn't the only one at Coolblue though, [Pat Hermans](https://twitter.com/phermens) and [Paul De Raaij](https://twitter.com/pderaaij) have also given several presentations. I also have the occasional beer or 7 with [Jaap Brasser](https://twitter.com/Jaap_Brasser), who travels around the world talking at various PowerShell events.

I learnt a lot from these guys, not only presentation skills but how they prepare, what their thought process is and how they deal with nerves before their talks. I probe them with questions, especially when I got closer to the presentations I had coming up.

Not only did they give me help, but they also applied a little pressure. They knew I wanted to start doing conference talks and improve my presentation skills, so would bug me with links to call for papers for upcoming conferences, and keep asking me when I would speak at their user group. Eventually, you run out of excuses and just have to say yes.

Tip: Surround yourself with people that are already doing what you want to achieve, ask them questions and listen to their advice.

# Actively take steps to get better

You are never going to stop being nervous about public speaking if you don't do anything about. Just like everything else (except if you are lucky and gifted from birth), you are going to need to work at it.

This includes all aspects of public speaking, preparation, how to tell a good story, how to deal with your nerves. All aspects need to be worked on so you can feel more and more comfortable getting on stage in front of people.

I worked on this in a few ways:

* Made it my goal that I would do two conference talks per year and let my manager at Coolblue know so they would support and push me
* I have always watched a lot of tech conference recordings, but I paid closer attention to the speaker and their techniques
* By saying yes and put my hand up a lot more for small presentations or talks at work
* By watching a ton youtube videos of presentation skills. One that sticks out in my mind is [How to Do a Presentation - 5 Steps to a Killer Opener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEDcc0aCjaA)
* By read a lot of interesting posts and articles on [/r/PublicSpeaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicSpeaking/)

# Practice

I think practice is the most important thing you can do before a presentation. Knowing a presentation of by heart really makes a difference when the nerves kick in. Being able to sort of "switch your brain off" and just let the words flow out of you like some sort of presentation robot (without the monotone voice) is the level of practice I got to before doing PSConf2017 and SplunkLive! Utrecht.

At the start of these talks I felt very nervous and shakey, but trying to get in the zone and falling back onto my practices really helped me get through.

Practice in the mirror, practice on colleges, practice on your family. Just practice, practice, practice.

I would also recommend trying not to use speaking notes. You may need them at the very beginning of your writing your presentation when you are in the creation phase, or for tricky phrases/sections of your presentation, but try limiting it to just that. The reason for this is it forces you to practice and know your topic. If you don't have notes, and you didn't practice, good luck presenting an awesome presentation once the nerves kick in.

You want to get to a level with your practising that you have a slide with the dot points, and that triggers you to say what you need to say.

When I was at SplunkLive Utrecht, the location handling the event couldn't get the presenter screens working correctly, so they had to use a tiny LCD monitor. If I had to rely on my speaker notes, I would have been screwed as the text was so small. Seeing this failure and knowing I was prepared enough to not need any notes give me a nice confidence boost.

With all my practices I also noticed certain parts of the presentation I would get stuck on or constantly screw up. I would make little notes during the practice and then refer back to where I got stuck. I either cut these out or refactored that part of what I wanted to say to make sure I was hitting my points accurately every time.

So - practice!

# Gathering honest feedback

With all the practice you will be doing to prepare for the event, it's going to get pretty boring speaking to your own face in the mirror so many times. Your partner also doesn't really care about how you migrated 100 applications from the ELK Stack to Splunk in a few weeks.

Lean on your work colleges for your practices, and ask for feedback. This is one of the things that originally shocked me about moving to the Netherlands - just how honest, direct and blunt the feedback was I was getting. No one was sugar coat it up for me, if they thought it was crap, they would say so. At first, I thought it was really weird, but I have really come to love this part of Dutch culture.

Before doing my talk at SplunkLive!, I practised my presentation in the office around 5 times in different groups of 2-3 people. I wrote down all of the feedback I received and would go back and refactor my presentation and then practice it on a different group a few days later.

This refinement process helped make my presentation the best it could be, but also gave me a ton of additional practice, and made me more comfortable telling the story in front of an audience (even if it was a small one).

All this practising and refactoring after the feedback takes time, so make sure you are prepared and do this a few weeks out before the talk. You want to lock the contents of the talk completely about two weeks out so you can just practice the same content up until the big day.

# Bringing some supporters

When the big day arrives, make sure you have a college or friend with you. Perhaps bring one of your colleges that you have bored to death with your multiple practices so they can see the big moment you have been working towards.

The night before SplunkLive!, one part of my brain was saying "no don't bring anyone - if you screw up then someone that knows you will know you are a failure!", but I am glad I did.

It helps you keep your mind distracted before the event to have someone you know to talk to, and it helps when they have done talks themselves (thanks, Pat!). It is also nice to have someone to vent your stress to before you have to go on stage.

Make sure you have your supporter take some pictures of you up on stage. It's nice to see what you looked like up on stage and have some pictures to be proud of and blast on Twitter once you have finished.

It also gives you something to refer back to later before your next talk so you can tell yourself "See, if done this before, I can do this again!".

# Conclusion

I am pretty proud of what I have achieved tackling my fear of public speaking over the last 18 months. I am definitely not over it yet, and still get stressed before big presentations (just ask my wife!). With more and more practice, and making sure I stick to my goal of two conferences a year, I hope public speaking will eventually just become a "normal" thing that I do and no longer be a big deal that I stress over.
