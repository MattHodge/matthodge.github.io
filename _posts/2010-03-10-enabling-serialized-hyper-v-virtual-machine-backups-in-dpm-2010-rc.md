Hello,

The old **hodgkins.net.au** blog has been re-directed here.

The **Enabling Serialized Hyper-V Virtual Machine Backups in DPM 2010 RC** article is out of date, but you can find a screenshot from the old article below.

The [ListVMsOnClusterForDPM](http://bit.ly/DPM2010RCPS) script is also available for download.
